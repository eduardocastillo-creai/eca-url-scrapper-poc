Especially given the scarcity of workers and continued hardships in filling roles, precautionary protocols and resources can help employers promote workplace health and safety. Having a partner like VensureHR offers employers access to OSHA training, on-site job and hazard assessments, informational webinars, and much more.\\n\\nGain Confidence in Recruiting and Retaining in a Competitive Labor Market\\n\\nIn an industry with increased demand and decreased labor force—so much so [2.1 million jobs are expected to be unfilled by 2030](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/energy-and-resources/articles/manufacturing-industry-outlook.html)—recruiting and retention are more important than ever. And a good handful of manufacturing leaders (38%) are already working on implementing stronger recruitment efforts in 2022. One way to improve retention efforts is focusing on upskilling. Contrary to the belief that automation and technology will replace human positions, implementing new technologies has led to superior productivity, increased experienced workers, and competitive compensation. The reason jobs remain unfilled is the skills gap. A [recent study](https://www.themanufacturinginstitute.org/press-releases/new-study-offers-insights-on-retaining-high-potential-skilled-workers/) showed that many younger workers (69% of employees under age 25) would stay with their current employer if offered training and development opportunities.\\n\\nAdditionally, improvements to employee engagement, employee recognition and feedback, and work-life balance and/or flexible work arrangements are [significant factors](https://vksapp.com/blog/manufacturing-trends) that can help business owners retain current employees.\\n\\nAdding an applicant tracking system and a team of HR experts can assist you in finding, screening, and hiring candidates faster and with greater success. Also, expanding or upgrading your benefits options can incentivize prospective employees to choose you over a competitor and for current employees to stay.\\n\\n![401k for manufacturing employees](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\n\\nInvest in Technology\\n\\nTechnology offers countless advantages to businesses, from insight into process efficiency and utilizing data to minimize unplanned downtime, improve material cost-savings, and create faster, more reliable communications.\\\\[1\\\\]\\n\\nAt VensureHR, we have built our cloud-based technology Vfficient to guide organizations in streamlining how they manage their business.
