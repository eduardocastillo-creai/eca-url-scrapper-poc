## Changing the Way Business Works with PEO Services
When you partner with a professional employer organization (PEO) like VensureHR, your administrative distractions are greatly reduced. Just think what it would mean to have the time to take your team or clients to lunch, mentor new employees, get to your kid’s game at the same time as the other parents, and attend family dinners.
And that’s just the start of what you can do when we act as your complete business solution provider. You’ll gain increased productivity throughout your week with PEO services, including [payroll](https://www.vensure.com/</payroll-administration/overview/>), [employee benefits](https://www.vensure.com/</employee-benefits/overview/>), [human resources (HR)](https://www.vensure.com/</hr-services/overview/>), and [regulatory compliance](https://www.vensure.com/</risk-and-compliance/overview/>) off your plate. You can make room for what you want to do instead of what you feel you have to do.
VENSUREHR IS DRIVING SOLUTIONS TO CHANGE THE LIFESTYLE OF BUSINESS. 
[ Schedule a peo consultation ](https://www.vensure.com/</lp/peo/consultation/>)
### Gain Control of Your Schedule
Working with a PEO like VensureHR means you no longer need to manage multiple vendors that don’t talk to each other. Services like [time clocks](https://www.vensure.com/<https:/www.vensure.com/payroll-administration/time-and-attendance/>), [payroll](https://www.vensure.com/<https:/www.vensure.com/payroll-administration/overview/>), learning management systems, [applicant tracking](https://www.vensure.com/<https:/www.vensure.com/hr-services/applicant-tracking/>), invoicing, and billing are all consolidated into one platform.
With VensureHR, you won’t be forced into a “fixed” package – our services and technology are unique to your needs. You receive flexible options to mix and match services. You may just need PEO payroll services, for example, or you may choose to go for the full package.

## Find a _New_ Perspective 
Businesses, like cars, have blind spots, and to no fault of your own. Running a company is not easy, no matter how long you’ve been in business. Our diagnostic approach determines your operations’ overall health and provides valuable insight into what’s working and what needs improvement. With this benchmark, we develop a strategic plan for PEO services to achieve greater success.

## Keep Your Team Growing and Thriving 
It’s no secret that great employees are the backbone of any business, and it’s never been more important to [attract and retain talent](https://www.vensure.com/<https:/www.vensure.com/recruiting-services/>). This can lead many businesses to wonder how they can compete for qualified people in a market. The Harris Poll reported that 80% of respondents said they would choose a job with benefits over an identical position with 30% more salary but no benefits.
That’s where a PEO can guide you. Our flexible services include progressive [recruiting](https://www.vensure.com/</recruiting-services/>) and access to a broad range of Fortune 500-level [employee benefits](https://www.vensure.com/</employee-benefits/overview/>).
Whether you have two employees or 200, they’ll have access to comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance along with [401(k) programs](https://www.vensure.com/</employee-benefits/401k-retirement/>) and specialty products like rental car discounts and pet insurance.

![An orange arrow graphic](https://www.vensure.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/arrow2.svg)
As an employer, you often sacrifice valuable time for your work life. Navigating the ebbs and flows of business makes prioritizing your personal needs and time with family and friends difficult. A PEO can alleviate you from those tedious tasks like fielding phone calls and emails, providing you with payroll services, ensuring a safe work environment, and allowing you to focus on the things that matter most.
Go home at the same time as your employees. Close your laptop. Reinvest in your hobbies. Reconnect with your employees during the lunch break you wish you could take. Enjoy the time a PEO gives back.

## Reduce Your Risk and Stay Compliant 
Compliance with more than 180 federal labor laws – not including state laws – adds another layer of [complexity](https://www.vensure.com/</risk-and-compliance/overview/>) to your day-to-day business operations. And with 73% of companies expecting remote employees by 2028, many businesses face remote and hybrid workplace state and federal regulations. For example, California requires employers to notify employees and receive consent before monitoring and recording email and phone conversations, whereas New York requires only one party to consent.
From workplace safety and workers’ compensation to taxes and paid leave, with VensureHR’s PEO services you’ll have experienced professionals to guide you through real-time compliance changes and updates.

### PEO Frequently Asked Questions 
What is a Professional Employer Organization (PEO)?
A professional employer organization, or PEO, provides organizations with administrative business solutions. A co-employment arrangement where the PEO becomes the employer of record by handling things like HR, payroll, regulatory compliance, and employee benefits so that you can focus on the operations side of your company. In return, you can focus on your team, clients, and profit-generating activities. [Learn more about what a PEO is here](https://www.vensure.com/<https:/www.vensure.com/what-is-a-peo/>).
Why do companies choose to work with a PEO?
According to [NAPEO](https://www.vensure.com/<https:/www.napeo.org/>), businesses that work with a PEO grow seven to nine percent faster than similar-sized businesses that don’t. They also have 10 to 15% less employee turnover and are approximately 50% less likely to go out of business.
I run a non-profit. Do PEOs only work with for-profit organizations?
Companies across various industries partner with VensureHR to take advantage of our PEO options, including non-profit organizations. Our PEO services often help non-profit organizations control costs so they can devote time and resources to their core mission.
I’m trying to find better benefits for my employees. Can a PEO help?
Absolutely. A PEO company like VensureHR allows you to offer the same quality benefits to your employees that a national or global brand provides.
Do my employees still work for me when I have a PEO?
The answer is yes. When you work with PEO services companies like VensureHR, you trust us to manage particular responsibilities. For example, we ensure employees are paid on time and that payroll processes meet all local, state, and federal rules. We also issue W-2s. You continue to oversee your employees and do things like giving them work assignments, making scheduling decisions, and handling the many other day-to-day tasks just like you always have.
Does VensureHR only offer PEO services to large businesses?
No. We work with businesses of all sizes, from sole practitioners to companies with 50, 250, or even 500 employees. That’s why we offer a flexible, tailored approach to PEO services for your business.
Does VensureHR provide PEO payroll services?
Yes, VensureHR provides payroll processing services as part of its PEO offering. If you need help with issuing paychecks and direct deposits, filing taxes and managing garnishments and unemployment, among other tasks, VensureHR can help!
